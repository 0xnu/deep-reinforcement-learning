## Deep Reinforcement Learning

To effectively learn Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), it's important to establish a solid foundation in several key areas. Below is a structured roadmap outlining the topics and skills needed to master [DRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning).

### Learning Path

#### 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started with DRL, ensure you have a solid understanding of the following foundational topics:

  - **Python**: The primary language for machine learning and deep learning.
  - **Libraries**: Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

#### 2. Machine Learning Basics

Understanding the fundamentals of machine learning is necessary before moving on to deep learning and reinforcement learning.

- **Core Concepts**
  - **Supervised Learning**: Linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

  - Online courses (e.g., Coursera, edX) on machine learning basics.

#### 3. Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks. Familiarize yourself with the following:

- **Neural Networks**
  - **Feedforward Networks**: Basic architecture and training.
  - **Activation Functions**: ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax.
  - **Backpropagation**: Understanding how neural networks learn.

- **Advanced Architectures**
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image processing tasks.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequential data.
